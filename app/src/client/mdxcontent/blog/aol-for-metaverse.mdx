## Omniverse

If you're interested in evolution theories or happen to work (or as me just
tinkering) with
[RL agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning), you're aware
that you have to teach agents while taking into account their lifespans &mdash;
evolution implies that an agent lives long enough to demonstrate its viability.

NVIDIA's Omniverse is designed for non-humans rather than us mere humans. Or, as
they put it, "...for humans as well." And today, there are already far more
non-humans than humans, and the gap is growing exponentially each year.

To create Omniverse, you must be proficient in the following areas:

- **Large-scale parallelization**. We should run millions of simulations with
  the domain randomization, i.e. introducing small deviations in each world (see
  [chaos theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory), best known for
  its Butterfly effect), and then sorting the results to select the most
  favorable deviations.
- **Machine learning** as applied thinking. Neural nets are expected to operate
  with more than 100 trillion parameters by 2022. Microsoft already has
  [ZeRO-Infinity](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/zero-infinity-and-deepspeed-unlocking-unprecedented-model-scale-for-deep-learning-training/)
  that can fit models with hundreds of trillions of parameters for training on
  current generation GPU clusters.
- **Photorealism**. Ray tracing and other similar rendering techniques need a
  large amount of computational power. Furthermore, in order for us humans to
  benefit from simulated evolution or RL results, such systems' internal time
  must be significantly (billions and trillions of times) faster than real-time.
- **Proper physics**. Not only mechanics, but also multi-physics, are involved.
  This necessitates advanced math and algorithm solvers. This, in turn,
  necessitates advanced modeling languages, which necessitate advanced compilers
  for various types of physical computers. In many ways, this is similar to what
  we understand as traditional CS, which is a discipline that binds math with
  physical computing and optimizes for available resources and timings. Precise
  physical modeling that is faster than real-time is computationally demanding
  &mdash; see how NVIDIA
  [handles it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ozs5EsvVGE).

In fact, before the advent of GPUs, it was impossible to discuss such use of
virtual worlds: it would be wishful thinking. Today this is all real, and Jensen
Huang is simply making a traditional entrepreneurial move: he creates an
ecosystem with a full technological stack, covering the equipment level by
software (often free), and teaching programmers (often for free) on how to use
this equipment. Actually, he does the same for ride-hailing industry, which is
expected to grow eightfold to $285 bln by 2030.

In this sense, you can see some parallels with Musk's SpaceX, which also singly
builds the full technological stack for flying to Mars, rather than waiting for
the conservative space industry to catch up with Elon.

### Open-source to dominate

Some of you may even recall Elon open sourcing of all Tesla patents "in the
spirit of the open source movement," which was done on the same exact
entrepreneurial grounds as Jensen Huang is now doing for Omniverse by sharing
all its current works. Nobody knows what share NVIDIA's Omniverse will have in
Metaverse, but the chances of it having a significant share due to Pixar's USD
and Huang's multilevel strategy are actually quite high.

### AOL for Metaverse

Just like first ISPs in early 90s, first MWPs (Metaverse worlds providers)
really have everything for huge commercial success. Humans will visit these
worlds through VR and non-humans that will live there will visit our world
through AR and robots &mdash; although, in our world there is no the domain
randomization and Metaverse perks like changable physics constants, varying
gravitation, time flow or concurrent simulations... In other words, everything
that makes this whole concept of the Metaverse so appealing to us.

## Why should I care?

The good news is that, within the next 5-7 years, anyone interested will be able
to expand their cognition capabilities with an exobrain (branded or
self-assembled), bringing the owner to the next level of metacognition &mdash;
which always leads to a change in occupation, career, lifestyle, and so on. Much
like how personal computers enabled many people to switch from blue collar to
white collar jobs in the 1990s. Or how laptop computers spawned an army of
digital nomads in the 2010s. Or how smartphones are allowing thousands of
creators to earn six figures on YouTube and TikTok right now.

If you're reading this, you probably want to be among the first to learn how to
combine and employ tools to build your own exobrain in order to maintain a
competitive edge in the creative economy market for years to come.

By tools, I mean:

- On-chain apps (smart contracts or dapps, i.e. everything Web3-related);
- Software (programs written by you or some cloud-based tools);
- Machines (your own or remote ones, hint: very likely equipped with NVIDIA
  GPUs);
- Edge devices (ultra-low power microcontrollers capable of on-device ML
  inference for analytics that is not stored on any servers and belongs solely
  to you);
- Bots that can perform actions in our world (physical robots, drones or
  vehicles);
- Avatars in Metaverse worlds for collaborating with other humans;
- Digital twins for your body, smart home, and business that run billions of
  concurrent simulations to advise you based on predictions of your health
  conditions next week, bills next month, profits next quarter, and so on;
- **Systems thinking** for exploring available options, resources and predicted
  outcomes;
- **Computational thinking** for formulating problems and their solutions in
  ways that involve software or hardware, not only for automation but also for
  exploring, analyzing, and comprehending processes that you are currently
  focused on.

You will soon be able to purchase branded exobrains from Meta, Microsoft, Apple,
or say Elon Musk, but you may want to build your own Metacognition stack for a
variety of reasons, such as enhancing standard capabilities, protecting the
privacy of your data, or pursuing specific goals in health, business, or
lifestyle.
